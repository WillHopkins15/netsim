Audio Tempo Induction
2006 paper - http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/arg/klap/gouyon-taslp-2006.pdf
- TI algorithms can reach over 80% accuracy, provided we do not insist on finding a specific metrical level.
- One conclusion for future development is that robust tempo induction entails the processing of frame features rather than that of onset lists.
- Many avenues for future work in audio tempo tracking are highlighted, as for instance the definition of the best rhythmic features and the most appropriate periodicity detection method.

- Applications and use cases for global tempo estimation are somewhat ill-defined.
- ACC1 and ACC2 are not suitable for some use cases due to their binary nature.
- The industry has not adopted p-score.
- Some currently used datasets are too small or do not have a tempo that is stable enough for ACC1 and ACC2.
- "It is impossible to solve a task for which neither use cases with success criteria have been well motivated and properly defined, not the suitability of metrics or datasets has been shown."
- Proposed a metric that measures how close and in which direction an estimate is to a reference value: octave error OE1 and OE2.
