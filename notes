Accuracy Metrics
ACC1 computes a 0 or 1 score per track, which indicates the correctness of an estimate, allowing a 4% tolerance. 
This is considered to strict for certain pieces (romantic piano music), and too lenient for others (electronic music).

ACC2 allows estimates to be wrong by the factors 2, 3, 1/2 or 1/3. 

P-Score is a metric that takes tempo ambiguity into account and treats it as an inherent property of music.

Major Problems
- Definition of specific metrical features is not given for most tasks that utilize tempo induction methods.

Algorithms based on a feature list creation block, that parses the audio data into a temporal series of features which convey the predominant rhythmic information to the following pulse induction block.

Schreiber + Muller
Single-step musical tempo estimation system based on a convolutional neural network.
Uses a mel scaled magnitude spectogram as input.

Bock et al.
Processes a preprocessed signal using a neural network that is trained to predict the positions of beats inside the signal. This results in a beat activation function wihch is then fed into a bank of resonating comb filters to determine the tempo.
Pre-processing - frame-wise processing. 'Therefore the audio signal is split into overlapping frames and weighted with a Hann window of same length before being transferred to a time-frequency representation by means of the Short-time Fourier Transform (STFT).'
Neural Network - outputs a beat activation function, which represents the probability of a frame being a beat position. 'Instead of processing the beat activation function to extract the positions of the beats, weuse it directly as a one-dimensional input to the bank of resonating comb filters.'
